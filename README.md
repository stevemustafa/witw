# witw
A URL shortner service... WITW tries to be cute and "little"


This project is written in C#/.NET CORE to showcase what can be done with SUSE CAP
This is a toy project and is expected to be usable for demoing features.

The subprojects in the solution each has a specific function and as such, the project is assumed to be based on a 
microservices architecture


###How does witw work
Witw has two methods by which it operates:
* Web UI manner
* API calls


####Intentions of activities and services
The intention is to showcase how a "monolithic" app is devolved into a microservices app.
As such, the first iteration will be released as a fully functional monolith with no microservices work involved, but 
then, version "2" will also show case how various components were broken apart.
I will attempt to also note my thought process and the research that was conducted.  

I will be tagging the various releases as they progress.

####Pronounciation
Imagine a witw kid twying haad to say witw...
